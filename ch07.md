## Slide 2

Introduction to Computing Using Python

The purpose of functions

- Wrapping code into functions has several desirable goals:
  - Modularity: The complexity of developing a large program can be dealt with by breaking down the program into smaller, simpler, self-contained pieces. Each smaller piece (e.g., function) can be designed, implemented, tested, and debugged independently.
  - Code reuse: A fragment of code that is used multiple times in a program—or by multiple programs— should be packaged in a function. The program ends up being shorter, with a single function call replacing a code fragment, and clearer, because the name of the function can be more descriptive of the action being performed by the code fragment. Debugging also becomes easier because a bug in the code fragment will need to be fixed only once.
  - Encapsulation: A function hides its implementation details from the user of the function; removing the implementation details from the developer’s radar makes her job easier.

## Slide 3

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Encapsulation through local variables

```python
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#62>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#63>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined

- def double(y):
- x=2
- print('x = {}, y = {}'.format(x,y))
- return x*y

Before executing function double(), variables x and y do not exist

- x and y exist only during the execution of function call double(5);
- they are said to be local variables of function double()

```python
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#62>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#63>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```python
res = double(5)
# Output: x = 2, y = 5
```

```python
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#62>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#63>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```python
res = double(5)
# Output: x = 2, y = 5
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#66>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#67>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined

After executing function double(), variables x and y still do not exist

Encapsulation makes modularity and code reuse possible

```python
x, y = 20, 50
```

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Function call namespace

- def double(y):
- x=2
- print('x = {}, y = {}'.format(x,y))
- return x*y

Even during the execution of double(), local variables x and y are invisible outside of the function!

```python
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#62>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#63>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```python
res = double(5)
# Output: x = 2, y = 5
x
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#66>", line 1, in <module>
- x
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```python
y
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#67>", line 1, in <module>
- y
- NameError: name 'y' is not defined

```python
x, y = 20, 50
res = double(5)
# Output: x = 2, y = 5
x, y
# Output: (20, 50)
```

y

5

Function call double(5)

x

2

```python
x, y = 20, 50
res = double(5)
```

- Every function call has a namespace
- in which local variables are stored

How is it possible that the values of x and y do not interfere with each other?

- Every function call has a namespace
- in which local variables are stored

Note that there are several active values of n, one in each namespace; how are all the namespaces managed by Python?

How does Python know which line to return to?

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Scope and global vs. local namespace

- Every function call has a namespace associated with it.
  - This namespace is where names defined during the execution of the function (e.g., local variables) live.
  - The scope of these names (i.e., the space where they live) is the namespace of the function.

- In fact, every name in a Python program has a scope
  - Whether the name is of a variable, function, class, …
  - Outside of its scope, the name does not exist, and any reference to it will result in an error.
  - Names assigned/defined in the interpreter shell or in a module and outside of any function are said to have global scope.

Introduction to Computing Using Python

How Python evaluates names

How does the Python interpreter decide whether to evaluate a name (of a variable, function, etc.) as a local or as a global name?

- Whenever the Python interpreter needs to evaluate a name, it searches for the name definition in this order:
  - First the enclosing function call namespace
  - Then the global (module) namespace
  - Finally the namespace of module builtins

b

- a = 0           # this a has global scope

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Exceptions, revisited

  - The reason behind the term “exception” is that when an error occurs and an exception object is created, the normal execution flow of the program is interrupted and execution switches to the exceptional control flow

- Recall that when the program execution gets into an erroneous state, an exception object is created
  - This object has a type that is related to the type of error
  - The object contains information about the error
  - The default behavior is to print this information and interrupt the execution of the statement that “caused” the error

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Catching and handling exceptions

It is possible to override the default behavior (print error information and “crash”) when an exception is raised, using try/except statements

- strAge = input('Enter your age: ')
- intAge = int(strAge)
- print('You are {} years old.'.format(intAge))

- try:
- strAge = input('Enter your age: ')
- intAge = int(strAge)
- print('You are {} years old.'.format(intAge))
- except:
- print('Enter your age using digits 0-9!')

```python
======================== RESTART ========================
# Output: Enter your age: fifteen
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "/Users/me/age1.py", line 2, in <module>
- intAge = int(strAge)
- ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'fifteen'

```python
========== RESTART ==========
# Output: Enter your age: fifteen
```

- Enter your age using digits 0-9!

Default behavior:

If an exception is raised while executing the try block, then the block of the associated except statement is executed

The except code block is the exception handler

Format of a try/except statement pair

- try:
- <indented code block>
- except:
- <exception handler block>
- <non-indented statement>

The format of a try/except pair of statements is:

- The exception handler handles any exception raised in the try block
- The except statement is said to catch the (raised) exception

- It is possible to restrict the except statement to catch exceptions of
- a specific type only

Modules, revisited

- When the module is executed (imported), then the module is (also) a namespace.

A module is a file containing Python code.

- When the module is executed (imported), then the module is (also) a namespace.
  - This namespace has a name, typically the name of the module.

- When the module is executed (imported), then the module is (also) a namespace.
  - This namespace has a name, typically the name of the module.
  - In this namespace live the names that are defined in the global scope of the module: the names of functions, values, and classes defined in the module.
  - These names are the module’s attributes.

  - This namespace has a name, typically the name of the module.
  - In this namespace live the names that are defined in the global scope of the module: the names of functions, values, and classes defined in the module.

Built-in function dir() returns the names defined in a namespace

To access the imported module’s attributes, the name of the namespace must be specified

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Importing a module

- When the Python interpreter executes an import statement, it:
  - Looks for the file corresponding to the module to be imported.
  - Runs the module’s code to create the objects defined in the module.
  - Creates a namespace where the names of these objects will live.

- An import statement only lists a name, the name of the module
  - without any directory information or .py suffix.
- Python uses the Python search path to locate the module.
  - The search path is a list of directories where Python looks for modules.
  - The variable name path defined in the Standard Library module sys refers to this list.

- When the Python interpreter executes an import statement, it:
  - Looks for the file corresponding to the module to be imported.

```python
import sys
sys.path
# Output: ['/Users/me', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/lib/python32.zip',
```

- . . .
- '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/lib/python3.2/site-packages']

current working directory

Standard Library folders

The Python search path

  - Suppose we want to import module example stored in folder /Users/me that is not in list sys.path

```python

```python
================ RESTART ================
dir()
# Output: ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', '__package__']
import example
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#79>", line 1, in <module>
- import example
- ImportError: No module named example
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/me')
import example
example.f
# Output: <function f at 0x10278dc88>
example.x
# Output: 0
```

```python

# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#79>", line 1, in <module>

```

  - By just adding folder /Users/me to the search path, module example can be imported

- When called without an argument, function dir() returns the names in the top-level module
  - the shell, in this case.

- 'an example module'
- def f():
- 'function f'
- print('Executing f()')
- def g():
- 'function g'
- print('Executing g()')
- x = 0  # global var

names in the shell namespace; note that example is not in

no folder in the Python search path contains module example

Top-level module

  - A computer application is a program typically split across multiple modules.
  - One of the modules is special: It contains the “main program”. This module is referred to as the top-level module.
    - The remaining modules are “library” modules that are imported by other modules and that contain functions and classes used by it

```python
=== RESTART ===
# Output: My name is __main__
```

print('My name is {}'.format(__name__))

name.py

- A module is a top-level module if:
  - it is run from the shell
  - it is run at the command line

- > python name.py
- My name is __main__

  - When a module is imported, Python creates a few “bookkeeping” variables in the module namespace, including variable __name__:
    - set to '__main__', if the module is being run as a top-level module
